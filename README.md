Foodie Favorites is a webapp created to help users make more informed decisions about what they eat when they go out to popular restaurants. It uses Natural Language Processing to classify food mentions in Yelp reviews and subsequently matches those mentions to menu items to help users find out what dishes are most popular.

## Problem
When going out to eat at a nice restaurant in the city, I frequently see people browsing their phones looking at Yelp reviews and pictures, frantically trying to make a decision about what to order before their waiter gets back to the table. Instead of wasting all that time, what if there was a service that would quickly and accurately tell you what is popular without having to fish for it yourself. So that's what I set out to do by creating Foodie Favorites.
